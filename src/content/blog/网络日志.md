This log records the development journey of my personal website, from its
inception to its current state.

### Phase 1: Foundation (February 9, 2026)

The project began as a static site built with **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**. I
focused on establishing a clean, fast, and modern foundation.

- **Core Structure**: Created the `BaseLayout`, `Header`, and `Footer`
  components to maintain consistency across pages.
- **Content Management**: Set up Astro Content Collections to manage blog posts
  efficiently.
- **Typography & Theme**: Implemented custom fonts and a dark mode toggle to
  ensure a comfortable reading experience in any lighting.
- **Responsiveness**: Refined the mobile experience, fixing hover interactions
  on the Contact page.
- **About Page**: Added interactive carousel sections to showcase personal
  interests like K-pop, movies, and food.

### Phase 2: Interactivity & Polish (February 10-11, 2026)

I shifted focus to enhancing user interaction and visual appeal, drawing
inspiration from Apple's design philosophy.

- **Comment System**: Integrated a backend-powered comment system using
  Supabase. This evolved to support threaded replies and a custom UI.
- **Notifications**: Replaced standard browser alerts with elegant "Toast"
  notifications for a seamless user experience.
- **Animations**: Added subtle entrance animations to the Blog index and About
  page to make navigation feel fluid.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Centered navigation elements and optimized hero images
  for better visual balance on all devices.
- **Contact Page**: Enhanced the WeChat contact method by replacing text with a
  hover-triggered QR code image.

### Phase 3: Performance & Optimization (February 12, 2026)

The latest updates prioritize performance and image quality, ensuring the site
is both fast and beautiful.

- **Search Redesign**: Overhauled the blog search bar with a blurred glass
  effect and minimalist icons.
- **Image Optimization**: Addressed page load lag by migrating heavy assets to
  `src/assets`.
- **High-DPI Support**: Implemented Astro's `<Image />` component with `widths`,
  `sizes`, and `quality` attributes. This ensures images look crisp on Retina
  displays (up to 2400px width) while maintaining optimal file sizes.
- **Vanta.js Experiment**: Explored adding a dynamic background effect but
  decided to keep the design clean for now.

This log will continue to update as the project grows.
